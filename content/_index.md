hey, I'm Tyler 👋, a professional nerd from the UK. I specialize in writing robust and efficient software tailored typically to the web and systems programming spaces. I mostly write Rust and Go, but you'll see me dabble with other languages and technologies as well, I like do a lot of sysadmin and networking stuff too.

I mostly spend my free time tinkering with random linux based stuff, contributing to open source or working. When I'm not being a nerd, you can find me playing FPS games, travelling, spending time in nature or just hanging out with friends.
